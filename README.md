# SocketFind

Socket find is a multiplayer space shooter entirely made in PyGame. The game has both a top-down view but also a first person view. All rendering is done based on canvas drawing and no external modules are used. 

The game includes both a client and server and allows for multiplayer over UDP. 

Spaceships have an arsenal of different weapons with different special effect and features ranging from short range flamethrower to long-range sniper and laser guns.
